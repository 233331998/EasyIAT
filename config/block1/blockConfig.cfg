For example, if the categories Trust and Distrust appear on separate sides above - words meaning Trust  would go in the Trust category, not the Distrust category. The green and white labels and items may help to identify the appropriate category. Use the E and I keys to categorize items into three groups left and right, and correct errors by hitting the other key.",
